## Introduction

This repository was initialized following [the InvenioRDM
instructions/](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/). It was then
customized to meet the needs of the Caltech community. This is only one
deployment example, and may or not be appropriate for your specific
institution and IT setup. 

## Installation

We currently deploy CaltechDATA on a m6i.xlarge AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu
20.04. We use this [cloud-init
file](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/cloud-init-examples/blob/main/caltechdata-init.yaml)
to do most of the initial setup.

### Install NVM

We haven't gotten NVM to install with cloud-init. Run `curl -o-
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`, then
reboot and type `nvm install 14`

### Install InvenioRDM

Clone this repository into /Sites, then go to that directory

```
invenio-cli install
invenio-cli services setup --no-demo-data
```

You'll need to add .env file to the repository directory, which includes secrets:

```
INVENIO_DATACITE_PASSWORD=
INVENIO_SECRET_KEY=
INVENIO_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
INVENIO_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
FLASK_ENV=
INVENIO_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LEVEL=
INVENIO_MAIL_PASSWORD=
```

This configuration uses S3 for storage. You need to change the bucket name with

`pipenv run invenio files location s3-default s3://caltechdata --default`

You can load the funders vocabulary with

```
wget https://zenodo.org/record/7038913/files/v1.5-2022-08-31-ror-data.zip?download=1 -O ror.zip
pipenv run invenio vocabularies import --vocabulary funders --origin "/Sites/caltechdata/ror.zip"
```

We have a local CaltechPEOPLE list, which is loaded with

```
pipenv run invenio vocabularies import --vocabulary names --filepath ./vocabularies-future.yaml
```

### Domain Configuration

You'll need a domain name, and set an A record to point the domain name to your
AWS instance.

Move nginx.conf to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

Copy redirect-map.conf to `/etc/nginx/`

Get a certificate with `sudo certbot --nginx`

Restart nginx with `sudo service nginx restart`

### Systemctl

We need three services to run InvenioRDM. Set them up with

```
sudo cp rdm_rest.service /etc/systemd/system/.
sudo cp rdm.service /etc/systemd/system/.
sudo cp rdm_celery.service /etc/systemd/system/.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start rdm
sudo systemctl start rdm_rest
sudo systemctl start rdm_celery
```

You should now have a InvenioRDM repository fully running!

## Usage

### Stopping InvenioRDM

```
cd /Sites/caltechdata
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl stop rdm
sudo systemctl stop rdm_rest
sudo systemctl stop rdm_celery
invenio-cli services stop
```

### Starting InvenioRDM

```
cd /Sites/caltechdata
invenio-cli services start
# Make sure there are no errors in the invenio-saml install
sudo systemctl start rdm_celery
sudo systemctl start rdm_rest
sudo systemctl start rdm
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

## Known issues and limitations

These insttallation instructions are intended for this specific Caltech
deployment, and you may need to modify them to work for your specific
configuration.
